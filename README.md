- Day 3: Added navbar and routings
- Day 4: Designed each page
- Day 5: Finalized stylings and code structure
- Day 6: Refactored code for readability
- Day 7: Fixed minor bugs and deployed site to netlify

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS / SCSS
- TypeScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned many skills, such as setting up routers with react-router-dom, using sass, writing readable code, creating reusable components and styles, and animating elements with framer-motion. I also tried TypeScript for the first time, but I still need more practice. I finished this project in a week, which is an improvement for my part.
